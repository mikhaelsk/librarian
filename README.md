# librarian
This is a pyqt project for librarian application. Librarian is used for categorization of documents and books on local and network drives.
Planned functionality:
- replenishable tag database
- search of books and documents by tags, foders, date, etc
- libraries (windows style: unions of different folders)
- logical hierarchical unions of documents (aka projects)
- various database storing: xml, SQL

abandoned.. such a pity
